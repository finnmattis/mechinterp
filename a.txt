emphasize miracousness in intro - understanding deep learning

mention convolution

weights bias
overfitting - more an issue in these more classical machine learning problems??????

mnemonic

details I glossed over: ROPE positional

a brief note on training 

attnetion dimension

key/querry embedding space

quantization not necessarily grid and codebook terminology

mention cascading of musicLM also musicLM NOT open source

Why RVQ - why not feed in Encodec vector
